Detection of fake news online is important in today's society as fresh news content is rapidly being produced as a result of the abundance of technology that is present. Fake news is nothing new. But, what is new is how easy it's become to share information – both true and false – on a massive scale.

Social media platforms allow almost anyone to publish their thoughts or share stories to the world. The trouble is, most people don't check the source of the material that they view online before they share it, which can lead to fake news spreading quickly or even "going viral."

Our work will consist of building a fake news classifier using machine learning.
